## Testing
1. Create directory for the homework (N is number of the homework)
```bash
mkdir ./homework-N
```
2. Download tests to the `./homework-N/public` directory
3. Go to the created homework directory
```bash
cd ./homework-N
```
4. Write program in `main.c`
5. Use `test` script to test homework
```bash
bash ../test.bash
```
## TODO
- Improve test script design
- Add valgrind checks
